	      <p>Every day Radio1190 has DJs that come in to the station and play a show for the world. These shows range from sports talk shows, climbing shows, vinyl shows, and live performances.</p>

	      <p>There is so much music to play, it's very overwhelming. Radio1190 gets CDs and vinyl every day from different labels across the world. Jaroki, the music director, organizes, and hand-picks albums to go on "rotation". This means that the radio station is always playing fresh new music. Once you find that perfect record it's time to go in to the studio.</p>

	      <p>Blast that music in the studio for the world to hear! The AM waves have reached all the way to Sweden! However, most of the audience is in Denver and Boulder.</p>

	      <p>Talking can be awkward.. especially if you don't know what to talk about. First, you always have to remind the listeners that they are listening to "Radio1190 KVCU and now 98.9 FM in Boulder, Colorado". After the intro you can talk about the weather, what shows are coming to town, or even about your cat.. Radio1190 is student run and is held together by the volunteers. No one is a professional so don't be intimidated by the mics!</p>
